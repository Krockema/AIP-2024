# Workshop - AI in Production

Our workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from the fields of AI and/or production investigating, developing, or exploring AI techniques in production. We aim to provide a platform for the exchange of ideas and experiences under the general topic of 'AI in Production', not specializing in certain fields of production nor AI but explicitly including production planning, control and optimization. Ideally, our workshop will enable us to standardize approaches for supporting production applying AI or to transfer these approaches from one area of application in production to another. Thus, the Workshop is not only intended for experts in artificial intelligence (in production), but explicitly also for professionals from production.

### Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to applications of AI in production to:
- explainable AI,
- interactive AI, 
- generative AI,
- process automation,
- quality control,
- controlling robots,
- supply chain management,
- predictive maintenance,
- planning and control,
- optimisation,
- configuration management,
- knowledge graphs in manufacturing

### CFP Contributions: Important Dates

- June, 23: paper submission deadline
- July, 7: application and demo paper submission
- July, 15: notification of acceptance
- September, 23 or 24: workshop (1 day)

We will accept three kinds of papers. Full Paper with 10 Pages, Short Paper with 5 Pages, and Demo paper with 4 Pages, including references. All accepted papers should be written in Springer LNCS Style and will be issued as Proceedings or special issue. All papers have to be submitted by easychair. (link is comming soon)

### Further Details

The workshop is planned to be  a single-track \textbf{one-day} event. It comprises two invited talks, approximately eight technical talks and the according discussions (of current work based on paper presetations), one poster and demo session, and one general discussion.
