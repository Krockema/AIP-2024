### Invited Speaker: Dirk Reichelt
Dirk Reichelt holds the Chair of Information Management at HTW Dresden and is a group leader at Fraunhofer IWU. He coordinates the work in the Industrial IoT Testbed at HTW Dresden and manages a large number of applied research projects at both institutions. He is the author of a large number of specialist articles on digitalisation in production. Together with his team and industrial partners, such as Infineon, Global Foundries, Volkswagen and BMW, he is researching process innovations for discrete production. One focus lies on the application of AI methods in the smart factory, robotics and production control. His work includes the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning for smart factories, reinforcement learning for robot programming, machine learning for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance, and the application of reinforcement learning to complex production tasks and dynamic resource allocation. His research team and he are also working on cognitive production systems and the generation of synthetic data for robust object recognition in industrial computer vision tasks.

### Invited Speaker: José Luiz Bittencourt
José Luiz Bittencourt combines academic excellence and comprehensive industry experience, making him a leading expert in the application of AI in manufacturing. Since 2021, Dr. Bittencourt has been serving as Program Manager at BMW Group, where his work focuses on optimizing battery production for electric vehicles through AI solutions. Before that, he was responsible for transitioning AI solutions from R\&D to industrial maturity at BMW.

Dr. Bittencourt earned his PhD in Mechanical Engineering at RWTH Aachen. He wrote his dissertation in cooperation with Bosch Rexroth as part of an EU-funded research project that explored the application of machine learning in industrial environments. His profound understanding and practical experience in integrating AI into manufacturing make him an ideal speaker to provide insights on the state and future of AI in manufacturing.
